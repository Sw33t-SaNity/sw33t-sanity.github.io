# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a developer and artist with a CS and Game Dev background from MSU. After working for several years, I'm now pursuing an IT Masterâ€™s in Australia. Passionate about indie games and interactive art, I love blending creativity with technology to craft unique experiences.
